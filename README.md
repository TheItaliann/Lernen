Yes/No Learning Tool Readme
Overview

Welcome to the Yes/No Learning Tool! This project is a simple electronic device designed to facilitate learning through a yes-or-no questioning format. The tool consists of two buttons, two LEDs, a microcontroller, and supporting circuitry. This readme will guide you through the setup, usage, and customization of the Yes/No Learning Tool.
Features

    Two buttons: one for 'Yes' and one for 'No'
    Two LEDs: green LED for 'True' and red LED for 'False'
    Microcontroller to process inputs and control LEDs

Getting Started

    Hardware Setup:
        Connect the buttons to the designated pins on the microcontroller. Ensure proper electrical connections.
        Connect the green LED to the 'True' pin and the red LED to the 'False' pin on the microcontroller.

    Software Setup:
        Install the necessary development environment for your microcontroller (Raspbarry pi).
        Upload the provided firmware (if available) or write your own code to handle button inputs and control the LEDs.


Usage

    Ask a Question:
        Press the 'Yes' button if the answer is true, or press the 'No' button if the answer is false.

    LED Feedback:
        The green LED will light up for a correct answer ('True').
        The red LED will light up for an incorrect answer ('False').

    Learn and Repeat:
        Use the tool to reinforce learning by asking questions and confirming the answers.
